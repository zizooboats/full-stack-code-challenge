# Zizoo Full-Stack Code Challenge

## Goal

Create a single web page rendering search results similar to https://www.zizoo.com/en/search/

## Tasks

- Create simple react component for a search listing card based located in this repo.
- Request search results from a GraphQL API for all **active** boats.
- Render the results using the API response and the react component.
- Create a basic filtering solution for boat length (< 15 OR >= 15) and boat year (< 2010 OR >= 2010).
- Bonus (not mandatory): Instead of a static boat photo, implement a photo-slider.
